# Specialization and return to scissors congruence

The results here are diagram chases.  Every deep comparison or
injectivity theorem appears as a field of an input structure; the proofs
below perform only the internal deductions made in the final section of
the manuscript.

/--
The specialization/Goncharov diagram chase.

If the relative defect is zero, its specialized endpoint is zero.  Fibre
comparison identifies that endpoint with `c_G` of the dual quadric defect.
Injectivity of `c_G`, projective duality, and the spherical map then forces
the reduced spherical defect to vanish.

The reduced-to-full argument using suspension, volume, and area.

This is the precise algebraic content of the manuscript's last paragraph:
zero after reduction makes the full defect a suspension; equal volume and
`Vol (Σq) = (π/2) Area(q)` give zero area; area classification then kills
the suspended class.
