# The external theorem contract

The manuscript uses deep theorems about relative motives, motivic
cohomology, Goncharov's quadric complex, and spherical scissors groups.
This file gives those results an explicit Lean boundary.  In particular,
none of them is installed as a global axiom: a caller must supply a value
of the relevant structure.

Motivic, fibrewise, and rationalized carrier types are explicitly rational
modules and their comparison maps are linear.  The integral spherical
scissors carriers `Plane`, `Full`, and `Reduced` remain additive groups.

The relative-object and three-weight inputs behind the slogan "primitive
equals an extension".  The face-complex, graded-piece, and strict-heart
certificates are deliberately separate: an implementation of motives must
discharge all three rather than treating them as one opaque comparison.

* `primitiveComparison` is the comparison between the kernel of the
  reduced middle coproduct and the endpoint `H¹(U,ℚ(2))` group.
* `h1_vanishes` packages the Garkusha--Borel computation that this
  endpoint group is zero on the universal rational base.

The reduced coproduct itself is part of the data because its explicit
Regge invariance is proved inside the manuscript rather than assumed here.

The narrow bridge from the two relative framed objects to the explicit
middle-coproduct calculation.

`splitPullback` is pullback to the splitting cover of the nonsplit face.
Its injectivity is named `finite_etale_sign_trace_injective` because the
manuscript proves it with the finite-étale trace/norm.  The two formula
fields identify the motivic coproducts with the six coordinate channels:
two fixed and four moving.  The mate formula is forced to use the actual
`reggeTransform`; consequently equality of the two expressions follows
from `six_channel_tensor_invariance` and is a theorem, not an input field.

External comparison maps used after specializing the universal identity to
a complex point.

`specialize` and `endpoint` keep the fibre operation visible instead of
silently identifying a relative framed coefficient with a `K₃` class.
`quadricCoproduct` is the field-level reduced coproduct and `goncharov` is
`c_G` on its kernel only.  `middleSpecialize` lets the proof derive fibre
primitivity from a commuting coproduct square rather than assuming it.
This typing matters: `c_G` is not a map on arbitrary quadric generators. `duality` is
projective duality; and `spherical` is Goncharov's injection from his
spherical presentation into all quadric classes.  The separate E7
presentation isomorphism is stored in `ProofContract`.
Projective duality is recorded as an involution, from which its
injectivity is proved internally; the other two injectivity statements
are precisely Goncharov's cancellation steps.

The standard scissors-theoretic statements used to pass from the reduced
class back to a finite-equidecomposition certificate.

`exact_at_full` says that the kernel of reduction is the image of
spherical suspension.  `rationalize` keeps the manuscript's passage to
`Pred(S³) ⊗ ℚ` explicit, and its injectivity records the consequence of
unique divisibility.  `suspension_volume` records
`Vol (Σq) = (π/2) Area(q)`.  `area_injective` is the classification of
spherical polygon scissors classes by area.  Finally, `cancellation` is
the Zylev--Gerling passage from equality in the scissors group to a finite
spherical equidecomposition.

/-- Named E1 interpretation obligations for the geometric input.  These
predicates are supplied by a model and are not definitions of spherical
tetrahedra inside Lean.  Their two concrete consequences used by the proof
are not hidden in these propositions:
the angle action appears literally as `reggeTransform` in
`CoproductBridge.split_formula_reggeMate`, and volume preservation is the
`ProofContract.regge_volume` equality. -/

The complete, explicit proof contract for one spherical Regge pair.

The fields ending in `_comparison` are the compatibility squares that
must be checked when geometric objects are translated between the
relative-motivic, fibrewise-quadric, and spherical-scissors languages.
Keeping them as named fields prevents a Lean proof from silently replacing
one realization by another.
