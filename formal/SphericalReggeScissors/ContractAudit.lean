# Contract consistency and necessity audit

Two small executable models guard against opposite specification errors.

1. `finiteContract` inhabits every field of the complete proof contract
   with finite carriers.  Thus the interface is not accidentally
   contradictory.
2. `boolCountermodel` has an involution and equal volumes, but distinct
   proposed class values.  It proves only that those two bare properties do
   not force class equality; it is not a model of the full geometric E1.
