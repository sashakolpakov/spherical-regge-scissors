# Lean formalization

This directory machine-checks the manuscript's finite algebra and its
conditional implication chain. It does **not** implement a theory of motives,
motivic cohomology, algebraic \(K\)-theory, Goncharov's quadric complex, or
spherical scissors groups in Mathlib.

The main result is **SphericalReggeScissors.spherical_regge_scissors**. It
returns a nonempty **FiniteEquidecomposition** certificate containing two
finite piece lists, proofs that they decompose the two tetrahedra, and a
pairwise-isometry proof. It is
universally quantified over a
**SphericalReggeScissors.ProofContract**. Supplying such a value means
supplying every external theorem and compatibility statement used by the
paper. A structure field is an ordinary hypothesis, not a global Lean axiom.

## Build

The project pins Lean and Mathlib:

- Lean v4.32.2
- Mathlib commit 905b95818eb32af7874a58b427f50c1711a5e96c

From the repository root:

~~~sh
cd formal

The repository-level verification also checks forbidden declarations and the
output of the axiom audit:

## Modules

- **ReggeMatrix.lean** proves the \(4\times4\) Regge involution,
  orthogonality, eigenspace formulas, and \(H^tH=4I\).
- **PhaseAction.lean** proves that \(u\mapsto\tau/u\) preserves
  \(\tau^2=abcd\) and is involutive in an arbitrary commutative group.
- **OrientationChart.lean** proves the algebra of both rational conic charts
  and the fixed-phase polynomial and deck transformation.
- **CoproductAlgebra.lean** proves the four-channel bilinear and tensor
  cancellation from \(H^tH=4I\).
- **ExternalInputs.lean** declares the typed trust boundary.
- **ThreeWeight.lean** proves the primitive-kernel and relative-defect
  deductions from that boundary.
- **Scissors.lean** proves the specialization/injectivity diagram chase and
  the suspension--volume--area argument.
- **Main.lean** assembles the conditional theorem and prints its axiom
  dependencies.
- **ContractAudit.lean** supplies an inhabited finite model of the complete
  contract and a countermodel showing that Regge involutivity plus equal
  volume alone do not imply scissors equality.

## What the external contract means

The carrier types in the Lean structures deliberately expose only the
operations used by the implication. Their intended mathematical meanings are:

| Lean component | Intended mathematics |
|---|---|
| **GeometricReggeInputs** and its two witnesses in **ProofContract** | E1's physical-pair and angle/length-action certificates; volume is a separate equality |
| **MotivicInputs.RelativeObject**, **coefficient** | the actual relative alternating-face objects and their framed coefficients |
| **isAlternatingFaceObject**, **hasExactThreeGradedPieces**, **strict_three_weight_heart_constructed** | separate certificates for the face construction, exact (0,1,2) graded pieces, and strict heart |
| **MotivicInputs.coproduct** | reduced middle coproduct on relative framed coefficients |
| **MotivicInputs.primitiveComparison** | \(\ker\bar\Delta\cong H^1(U,\mathbf Q(2))\) |
| **MotivicInputs.h1_vanishes** | the Garkusha--Borel vanishing on the rational chart |
| **CoproductBridge.relativeOriginal**, **relativeReggeMate** | coefficients of the two relative oriented quadric face objects |
| **split_formula_original**, **split_formula_reggeMate** | exact relative coproduct/cross-ratio identification |
| **finite_etale_sign_trace_injective** | descent, including the nonsplit sign-Artin channel |
| **movingLeft**, **movingRight**, and the four fixed-channel fields | the six explicit channels on a splitting cover; the mate is forced to use the checked Regge transform |
| **SpecializationInputs.specialize** | pullback of the relative coefficient to a complex point |
| **SpecializationInputs.endpoint** | endpoint extension in \(H^1(\mathbf C,\mathbf Q(2))\) |
| **SpecializationInputs.quadricCoproduct**, **goncharov** | the field-level coproduct and Goncharov's \(c_G\), whose domain is literally its kernel |
| **SpecializationInputs.middleSpecialize**, **quadric_coproduct_specialization** | the commuting square from which Lean derives fibre primitivity |
| **fibre_endpoint_eq_cG** | the sign-, frame-, twist-, and duality-compatible fibre comparison |
| **SpecializationInputs.duality** | projective duality on quadric-scissors classes |
| **SpecializationInputs.spherical** | Goncharov's injection from his rational spherical presentation to quadric classes |
| **ProofContract.presentationComparison** | E7's explicit isomorphism from the rationalized geometric reduced group to Goncharov's presentation |
| **ScissorsInputs.rationalize**, **rationalization_injective** | the explicit passage from the geometric reduced group to its rationalization |
| **ScissorsInputs** | suspension exactness, rationalization, area classification, volume, and cancellation to **FiniteEquidecomposition** |

The manuscript additionally spells out the geometric obligations which
produce these Lean interfaces: construction of the relative face motive,
its exact three graded pieces, a strict three-weight heart, Artin trace
compatibility, and base change to Goncharov's field-level coefficient. The
first three have separate certificate fields in the contract; none of these
obligations is constructed by Lean or follows from ordinary rational homology.
The rational carrier types and their comparison maps are respectively
\(\mathbf Q\)-modules and linear maps in Lean; the three integral scissors
carriers remain additive groups.

The abstract geometric predicates in the contract are interpretation
obligations, not definitions smuggled in under mathematical names. A model
must prove that its actual face objects, physical tetrahedra, decompositions,
and piece isometries satisfy them. The exhaustive assignment of all contract
fields to E1--E8 is recorded in **contract_map.json** and checked by
**scripts/check_contract_parity.py**.

## Why motives are not modeled as vector-space complexes

Rational vector spaces form a semisimple category. Consequently their
first extension groups vanish and every bounded complex splits into its
cohomology. Replacing the proposed motivic object by a plain rational complex
would therefore erase the endpoint extension whose class is meant to lie in
\(H^1(U,\mathbf Q(2))\), or equivalently the relevant weight-two part of
\(K_3\). The formalization instead treats the existence and comparison of
that extension as an explicit external hypothesis and checks everything
deduced from it.

## Reading the result correctly

The theorem **spherical_regge_scissors C** proves the conclusion for any
supplied **ProofContract C**. It does not construct a contract for geometric
spherical tetrahedra. Thus it certifies:

> The manuscript's conclusion follows from its named external statements
> and its checked internal algebra.

It does not yet certify:

> The external relative-motivic bridge exists with the required
> compatibilities.

boundary.
